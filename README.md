# xslt_exploration

## Purpose

With upcoming RIAMCO & mods/ead-maker xml/stylesheet work, I put together this little demo of programmatically applying a stylesheet to an xml file to get transformed output. Also shows how stylesheets can perform calculations.

Suggestion to team, feel free to add/update this repo to store "recipes" for how to do certain things; that'll benefit all of us.

If we do this, we could, eg, rename `transform_code.py` to, say, `ex01_calculation.py`, and perhaps rename the relevant source-files to, eg, `ex01_source.xml`, etc.
