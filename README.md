# xslt_exploration

## Purpose

With upcoming RIAMCO & mods/ead-maker xml/stylesheet work, I put together this little demo of programmatically applying a stylesheet to an xml file to get transformed output. Also shows how stylesheets can perform calculations.

Suggestion to team, feel free to add/update this repo to store "recipes" for how to do certain things; that'll benefit all of us.
